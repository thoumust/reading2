<p>Many indigenous peoples have strongly criticized the modernization theory and dominant development model promoted by western industrialized countries and emulated by most post-colonial nation-states. The economic growth-driven development model is inherently discriminatory against indigenous peoples, their traditions and cultures, worldviews and socioeconomic and political systems. In an earlier paper, this writer argued that:

Development is essentially a dominating process where destinies of peoples were shaped according to a Eurocentric perception of the world ... Our indigenous worldviews and philosophies, value systems, cultural, social, political and economic systems, which include our traditional livelihoods. were seen as obstacles to development and modernization. Thus, these were denigrated, destroyed or obliterated. Development, which was adopted as one of the pillars of nation-state building became one of the root causes of the conflicts between nation-states and indigenous peoples.

 

Modernization is the "idea that the state of economic and political advancement enjoyed by the United States and the industrialized West was normative. and that it was in the U.S. national interest, as well as the general interest of all people, that steps be taken to bring the other two-thirds of humanity up to a comparable level." If this is the standard which developing countries should reach to be considered "developed," impliedly, other ways of living would have to be destroyed or reconfigured to reach this goal.

When the United Nations was established after World War Il, one of its first actions was to classify the world into developed and developing countries. The development process was defined to mean that changes in the developing countries should take place in order to attain the level of developed countries. Development became equated with economic growth. Thus, any country aspiring to be modern and developed should aim for increased economic growth. And nation-states are the key actors mainly responsible in bringing about national economic development.

International cooperation is regarded as one of the means to effect development. But such cooperation should be grounded on principles of equality, right of peoples and nations to self-determination and permanent sovereignty over natural resources.

Broad and Cavanagh, global development trend experts, describe how developing countries viewed their roles before the 1980s:

Prior to the 1980s, most developing countries favored a fairly strong governmental role in development planning and policies, fearing that unfettered markets in a world of unequal nations would put them at a disadvantage. In fact, most of the governments maintained trade restrictions of some sort and gave preferences to national over foreign investment. Regulating financial flows in and out of a country was the norm for both developed and developing countries. In many poorer nations, governments pursued different versions of what became known as "import-substitution industrialization," wherein they created incentives to help certain industries take off.

 

Unfortunately, the strong role of the state in development planning and implementation gradually weakened because neoliberal economists wielded greater influence in the development discourse. The UN launched four Development Decades from the 1960s to 2000, with the aim of achieving independent national economic development for developing countries. Sadly, these Decades failed to achieve their objectives. xxx. To address this, it established the International Development Strategy (IDS) for the Fourth Development Decade (1991-2000), which included speeding up the pace of economic growth in developing countries; devising a development process that meets social needs, reduces extreme poverty, develops and uses people's capacities and skills and is environmentally sound and sustainable. These objectives are reflected in the human development framework.

In 1986 the UN General Assembly adopted the Declaration on the Right to Development, and in 1990 established a Working Group of Governmental Experts to discuss concrete recommendations on how this should be done. The group identified obstacles to the realization of human rights, and these were:

concentration of economic and political power in most industrialized countries;
non-democratic decision-making processes of international economic, financial and trade institutions;
structural inequalities in international relations between countries;
existing trade and financial arrangements dictated by a small number of countries for their own benefit;
international development strategies which have been oriented merely towards economic growth and financial considerations at the expense of human rights.
 

Unfortunately, these kinds of critical analysis and conclusions, which come out of the UN itself, are not used to design the necessary next steps to address the problems.

During this same period (1960-2000), many indigenous peoples' territories in developing countries were beset with large-scale deforestation, massive extraction of oil, gas and minerals, and huge infrastructure construction like mega-hydroelectric dams. This experience with "development" created great trauma for indigenous peoples, as it caused their forcible displacement and militarization, destroyed ecosystems they had lived in for thousands of years, denigrated their cultures and identities, and violated many of their other collective and individual rights.

The World Bank, International Monetary Fund and even UN programmes and other agencies like the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) became vehicles for promoting dominant development paradigms. The dogma that the unfettered market is the best way to produce economic growth and organize societies dominated development discourse and practice, and those against it were side lined.

Former US Vice President Al Gore described the triumph of the market in a recent piece:

The decisive victory of democratic capitalism over communism in the 1990s led to a period of philosophical dominance for market economics worldwide and the illusion of a unipolar world. It also led to, in the United States, a hubristic "bubble" of market fundamentalism that encouraged opponents of regulatory constraints to mount aggressive effort to shift the internal boundary between the democracy sphere and the market sphere. Over time, markets would most efficiently solve most problems, they argued. Laws and regulations interfering with the market carried a faint odour of the discredited statist adversary we had just defeated.

 

Indigenous peoples in the Philippines: A case of development aggression.

It is not any surprise that there is much resistance to the use of the term "development" because of many negative experiences with it and the modernization process. Indigenous peoples were among the first to oppose the idea of development and economic growth. In the Philippines, the indigenous peoples, in particular the Igorot peoples of the Cordillera region, advanced the concept of "development aggression" to refer to the way our human rights are violated by the State in the development process. In the 1970s, we successfully resisted the Chico River Hydroelectric Dam Project, which was funded by the World Bank and imposed on us by the Marcos dictatorship in the guise of development. Comprised of four big dams to be built along the Chico River, the project would have displaced around 300, 000 Kalinga and Bontoc peoples from their ancestral territories. The government and World Bank announced that the project was for national development and that the minority had to sacrifice for the good of the greater number. In 1975, the affected indigenous peoples, neighboring communities, churches, and some national and global NGOs sent a letter to then World Bank President Robert McNamara requesting him to stop the project.

This struggle heightened our awareness about human rights instruments, xxx. We questioned the kind of development being pushed. "For what and for whom was this development?" Our communities became heavily militarized and subjected to aerial bombings; many were arrested and tortured. and the dam resistance's key leader. Macli-ingDulag, was assassinated by the military in 1982. When the Marcos dictatorship fell in 1986. The Aquino government cancelled the project and the World Bank stopped the loan.

This successful protest of the Igorot peoples, along with that of indigenous peoples in Brazil against the similarly WB-funded Polonoroeste project in the early 1980s, led to the formulation and adoption of the World Bank's Operational Manual Statement on Tribal Peoples (OMS 2.34) in 1982. This was the very first time a multilateral development bank developed a manual to govern its projects involving indigenous peoples.

We fought and stopped the Chico Dam Project not merely for environmental reasons but to oppose the threatened loss of our ancestral territories and burial grounds and the arrogance of the Marcos dictatorship and the World Bank to define what development should be for us. We could not allow our ancestral territories to be destroyed. and our traditional livelihoods, cultures and socio-political systems to disappear by the hubris and power of those who regarded us as backward and primitive.

 

Economic growth, GDP and human development

The concept of human development emerged as a response to criticisms of the impacts of colonization and of the dominant economic development model. While it is UNDP and father of the Human Development Report, Mahmoud UI Haq, who are associated with human development, it should be recalled that as early as 1953, Canada raised the issue of human development in response to the Soviet Union's criticism of its neglect of the "human development" of the Inuit (indigenous peoples in the Arctic). Canada established the Department of Northern Development (1953) whose goal was "human development in the North to be measured by three indicators: longevity, education and standard of living."

In an era where GDP is the main measure for wellbeing and economic growth is the main development goal, the Human Development framework has remerged to provide a balance between economic growth and social development. It aims to put people back at the center of development and enlarge people's choices and freedoms. The Human Development Index links human development and economic growth, and expanded GNP and income-based measurements. According to Ul Haq, the HDI was developed to "measure at least a few more choices besides income and to reflect them in a methodologically sound composite index.:" He cited four ways to create desirable links between human development and economic growth: investments in education, health and skills and more equitable distribution of income. Social inclusion is a strong element of this framework. The Gender Development Index (GDI) and the Gender Empowerment Measurement (GEM) were subsequently developed to ensure that women's issues are addressed by the development process.

Inspite of the attempts to put a proper balance between economic and social development, the dominant framework for economic growth and development remained and was further entrenched. Neoliberalism, represented by the Washington Consensus, succeeded in relegating the State to facilitate easy access by rich countries and their corporations to lands and natural resources, markets (including financial market) and human resources in developing countries. When developing countries fell into the debt trap in the 1980s, the World Bank and International Monetary Fund provided structural adjustment loans (SALS) that came with conditionalities that weakened the State and strengthened the role of the market.

The main policies promoted by the Washington Consensus are:

a) trade liberalization and export-led growth,
b) financial liberalization and financial capital mobility,
c) fiscal and monetary austerity
d) privatization, and
e) labor flexibility."
The globalization of this framework was systematically pursued by international financial institutions like World Bank and IMF, bilateral aid donors and multilateral and bilateral trade agreements. Thus, laws on mining, investment, land tenure, and labor were further liberalized. These laws allowed further expropriation of indigenous peoples' lands and waters, more aggressive extraction of natural resources and wanton destruction of ecosystems in indigenous territories.

The poverty situation of indigenous peoples in most parts of the world has worsened because they have been dispossessed of their ancestral lands and resources. But the observation that the poorest indigenous peoples are found in territories which possess the richest natural resources is true. In Latin America, studies by World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank conclude that a strong correlation exists between indigenous peoples and poverty indices. The 2002 World Development Indicators show that indigenous peoples inhabit territories with vast deposits of oil, gas, minerals and forests BUT compose the vast majority of the poorest of the poor.

The multiple crises we face today prove the failure of the Development Decades, the Washington Consensus and globalization. Poverty has not been alleviated, much less eradicated except for a very few. UN reports and many other studies show evidence "that economic globalization has consistently concentrated wealth in ever smaller number of countries and economic elites.” The top one percent of the world population now account for 40 percent of the world's net worth; the richest 10 percent own 85 percent of the global assets and their holdings are increasing. The world's 946 billionaires have wealth equal to two-thirds of humanity. Never in our world's history have such gross inequality and immoral disparity been seen.

A recent UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) report described the worsening poverty situation:

Estimates suggest that, in 2009, between 47 and 84 million more people have remained poor or will have fallen into poverty in developing countries and economies in transition than would have been the case had pre-crisis growth continued with its course. The setback was felt predominantly in East and South Asia, where between 29 and 63 million people were likely affected, of whom about two-thirds were in India. By these estimates, the crisis has trapped about 15 million more people in extreme poverty in Africa and almost four million in Latin America and the Caribbean.

 

The phenomenal economic growth in China, India and Malaysia, which reduced the number of extremely poor people, took place because they did not follow the Washington Consensus. Most developing countries are not in this state as they were compelled to implement the Washington Consensus to continue borrowing from the World Bank, other multilateral financial institutions and bilateral donors. In fact, after the 2008 global financial and economic crisis, the situation further deteriorated in many developing countries, highly comprising their achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.

Taking all these into consideration, the UN Permanent Forum's recent "International Expert Workshop on Indigenous Peoples' Development with Culture and Identity" (January 13-15, 2010) concluded that:

The blind faith in self-correcting, efficient markets and the promotion of infinite consumption of finite resources coupled with the promise that economic liberalization will lead towards rapid economic growth, all too often, leads to the over-exploitation of natural resources where indigenous peoples, their cultures and identities, are seen to be "obstacles" to progress because their lands and territories are rich in resources and indigenous peoples are not willing to freely dispose of them. Further, indigenous peoples’ cultures and values are seen to be contradictory to the values of the market economy such as accumulation of profit, hyper-consumption and competitiveness. In many countries, the history and the continuing practice of assimilation has resulted in blanket public policies which excluded indigenous peoples and are discriminatory towards their cultures and identities. The pursuit of economic growth, at all costs, are not only destructive for indigenous peoples but for the rest of humanity and the planet.

 

Development, culture and identity

The process of nation-state building in the post-colonial era and the view that the only development track is the path of rich nations in the North, have undermined indigenous peoples' cultures and identities. The concepts of one nation, one state, one national culture, one national language is antithetical to realities in the nation-state. Most nation-states are multinational, multicultural and multi-lingual. The 2004 HDR on Cultural Liberty reported that "the world's nearly 200 countries contain some 5,000 ethnic groups. Two thirds have at least one substantial minority - an ethnic or religious group that makes up at least 10% of the population." Inspite of this reality, the report also recognized that "political leaders and political theorists of all persuasions have argued against explicit recognition of cultural identities - ethnic, religious, linguistic, racial. The result, more often than not, has been that cultural identities have been suppressed, sometimes brutally, as state policy - through religious persecutions and ethnic cleansings, but also through everyday exclusion and economic, social and political discrimination.

Because nation-states adhere to the notion that strength is based on keeping and protecting national unity, sovereignty and their boundaries, cultural diversity and indigenous peoples are regarded in a poor light. Many governments resist indigenous peoples' assertion that they have the right of self-determination, which includes determining their political status vis-a-vis the State and freely pursuing their economic, social and cultural development. Since these rights conflict with its eminent domain claims, its power to reclassify lands and its fixation on the idea that human rights is about individual rights, the State has either assimilated indigenous peoples, suppressed them or discriminated against them.

Since the State is the main agency and unit for development and many nation-states are ruled by dominant populations, indigenous peoples' cultures are considered obstacles to national progress and development. It is very difficult for States to accommodate sub-state entities, especially indigenous peoples whom they usually consider backward, into the modernization framework of nation-state building. This is one reason why many conflicts arise in indigenous territories.

Indigenous peoples have the most diverse cultures and speak 4,000 languages of the world's remaining 6,000 languages. The UNESCO defines culture as the set of distinctive spiritual, material, intellectual and emotional features of society or a social group that encompasses not only art and literature, but lifestyles, ways of living together, value systems, traditions and beliefs. To indigenous peoples, culture is vital in determining their economic and social wellbeing. The UN report on The State of the World's Indigenous Peoples highlights this:

Indigenous peoples have rich and diverse cultures based on a profound relationship with their land and natural resources. Dichotomies such as nature vs. culture do not exist in indigenous societies. Indigenous peoples do not see themselves as outside the realm of nature, but as part of nature, and they have their own specific attachment to their land and territory and own specific modes of production based on a unique knowledge of their environment. Nor do indigenous peoples emphasize a radical duality between the sacred and the mundane as happens in Western culture. In many indigenous cultures, social and political institutions are part of the cosmic order, and it is on the basis of their worldview, beliefs, values and customs that indigenous peoples define their customary laws and norms. Another salient characteristic of indigenous cultures is that they are based on a collective perspective. In the same way that indigenous peoples consider their lands and resources to be collective assets, they see their cultural values and activities - as function of the group not individuals.

 

Culture, values and rituals, indeed, are the glue that keep the social fabric of indigenous communities together. And the continuing practice of these cultures and values has ensured that cultural diversity is still vibrant, and that tropical forests and better protected ecosystems remain in the world today. The UNDRIP is cognizant of the link between indigenous peoples' development and culture, which is why 16 of its 46 articles refer to culture.

The connection between culture and development is similarly recognized by UNESCO's Declaration on Cultural Diversity adopted in 2001. The Declaration states that cultural diversity is one of the roots and a factor of development (Art. 3) and a means to achieve moral, emotional and spiritual existence. It stresses that the guarantee for cultural diversity to flourish is the respect of human rights. Its action plan for implementation is aimed at deepening the international debate on questions relating to cultural diversity, particularly its links with development and its impact on policy-making. Another objective is achieving respect and protection of traditional knowledge particularly with regard to environmental protection and management of natural resources.

The cultures of indigenous peoples who live in different ecosystems are linked to the way they regard and protect these ecosystems. The indigenous peoples in Cambodia, for example, consider a part of their forests as Spirit Forests and thus protect these at all costs, being where their deities and ancestors' spirits reside. They also protect these to secure and safeguard their forest-based traditional livelihoods and ecosystem. Their resistance against the expansion of Economic Land Concessions, which are deforesting their territories on a massive scale, is growing stronger despite repression by the military and powerful groups within the government and corporations. Similarly, the Tagbanua indigenous peoples in Palawan, Philippines fought for the delineation of their ancestral waters NOT MERELY to better control the waters which are part of their ancestral territories, BUT because these are sacred grounds where their water deities reside, and which they are thus obligated to protect.

Nation-state building, which sets arbitrary boundaries of national territories, however, has helped to fragment indigenous communities and cultures. Many indigenous peoples were separated when nation-states carved out their territories. The Naga peoples for instance are found in Myanmar and India, prompting the Chief of the Naga Hoho (Traditional Council of Elders), who lives in a longhouse, to say he eats in Burma and sleeps in India. Similarly, the Sami peoples find themselves divided among Norway, Finland, Sweden and Russia. This has posed complications for Sami reindeer herders whose cultural practice and livelihoods require access to their traditional grazing lands which cut across these national boundaries. They had to fight hard to get the three Scandinavian countries to recognize their need to freely move across national boundaries, but up to now they experience difficulties in gaining access to their Sami relatives in Russia. Denying such access violates their right to traditional livelihoods and culture, which are part of their Sami identity, and their right to development.

It is imperative to bring in culture into the framework of alternative development thinking and practice. If States acknowledge that the right to culture or cultural liberty is vital for human development and thus work towards its realization, there is no question it will have a positive impact on indigenous peoples and on the entire planet. The 2004 HDR Report clearly points this out:

Cultural liberty is a vital part of human development because being able to choose one's identity - who one is without losing the respect of others or being excluded from other choices is important in leading a full life. People want the freedom to practice their religion openly, to speak their language, to celebrate their ethnic or religious heritage without fear of ridicule or punishment or diminished opportunity. People want the freedom to participate in society without having to slip off their chosen cultural moorings.

 

Human rights-based approach to indigenous peoples' development. A holistic approach is important in developing an alternative path to development, and this has been recognized by the Expert Workshop on Development with Identity and Culture: Focus on Articles 3and 32of UNDRIP:

The failure of the dominant development paradigm as evidenced by the lingering global economic crisis and the environment crisis of climate change and erosion of biological diversity signals the need to evolve alternative ways of thinking and doing development. Indigenous peoples' visions and perspectives of development provide some of these alternatives which should be articulated and discussed further. Indigenous peoples' concept of development is based on philosophy that humans should live within the limits of the natural world, underpinned by the values of reciprocity, solidarity, equilibrium and collectivity. Development with culture and identity is characterized by having a holistic approach, seeking to build on collective right, food security and sovereignty and greater control and self-governance of lands, territories and resources, it builds on tradition with respect for ancestors, but looking forward.

 

The focus on Articles 3 and 32 is to ensure that any development work will have the UNDRIP  as its basic foundation. The human rights-based approach to development is a critical element of a new design of development. The FPIC of indigenous peoples, enshrined in six articles of UNDRIP, should be obtained before any development project is brought into their communities. Article 10 says indigenous peoples shall not be forcibly removed from their lands and territories, and cannot be relocated without their FPIC. This is not an easy principle because most nation-states claim ownership over sub-surface resources, which means minerals, oil, gas and water. This explains their aversion to the idea of getting FPIC of affected peoples when they want to exploit these resources. However, indigenous peoples who know their rights assert the centrality of FPIC in any development process that directly affects them.

The "UN Statement of Common Understanding of Human Rights Based Approaches to Development Cooperation and Programming" says:
All programmes of development cooperation, policies and technical assistance should further the realisation of human rights as laid down in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international human rights instruments;
 

Human rights standards contained in, and principles derived from, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international human rights instruments guide all development cooperation and programming in all sectors and in all phases of the programming process;
 

Development cooperation contributes to the development of the capacities of "duty-bearers" to meet their obligations and/or of "rights-holders" to claim their rights."
 

Integrating Environment into Development

Environmental, social and cultural costs should likewise be accounted for in measuring a society's progress. A shortcoming in the Human Development framework is the disappointing weak linkage between development and environment. As early as 1992, Agenda 21 of the UN Conference on Environment and Development had already consolidated the concept of sustainable development, which integrates environmental issues with development policies. This means integrating natural resource constraints and environmental damage in measures of economic or human development.

Within this framework, the measurement of economic development includes costs of using the environment as production inputs and as waste sinks such as for carbon dioxide sequestered by forests and oceans. Therefore, the costs of services provided by ecosystems and natural resource use as well as costs for protecting and preventing environmental degradation should be factored into the universal System of Standard National Accounts (SNA). As of now, SNA only recognizes depreciation of man-made capital assets but not of ecological assets.

xxx The UNDP funded the Integrated Environmental Management for Sustainable Development (IEMSD) in 1994 and made the UN System of Integrated Environmental and Economic Accounting (SEEA) as part of it. xxx 

In the Philippines, the National Statistical Coordination Board (NSCB) has led attempts to integrate the SEEA into SNA. The NSCB head Romulo Virola stated:

With environmental accounting, the state of the environment can he assessed - how much resources are available to us, how much renewable resources are being consumed, how fast non-renewable resources are being depleted, the quality of the environment and the remaining resources, their economic importance/value and how much is spent by man for the protection of the environment. Through environmental accounting, it is possible to reveal the economic distortions in the production and consumption activities resulting from the subsidies granted to economic activities that are heavily dependent on the environment..."

 

Unfortunately, these efforts have not yet resulted in SNA's expansion to fully integrate environmental costs. All this good work done by well-meaning UN technocrats and government officials are not easily translated into policy, as most nation-states continue to impose the prevalent global economic growth framework. The Philippines, for instance, is becoming NOTORIOUS for ignoring the cries of indigenous peoples whose lands are being given to foreign mining corporations despite the lack of free consent of affected communities. The Philippines is a CLASSIC CASE of a country which has followed World Bank and IMF prescriptions to the letter, and thus its TERRIBLE economic and environmental state.

The devastating typhoons the Philippines experienced in late 2009 previews what can happen more frequently for countries in typhoon or hurricane belts if greenhouse gas emissions will not abate. Two unprecedented typhoons battered the capital of Metro Manila and the Cordillera region for three weeks. The first one, internationally named Ketsana, poured in six hours the average monthly rainfall the country gets, causing widespread flooding, land erosions, thousands of dead and missing persons and millions of dollars’ worth in destruction to property in Metro Manila. The second, Parma, hit the Cordillera region, the ancestral territory of more than one million Igorot peoples. It lingered for 10 days, unlike a normal typhoon which lasts from 24 to 48 hours, resulting in massive landslides especially in communities already weakened considerably by mining operations, killing hundreds of people, destroying houses and farms, and burying roads that isolated communities.
Igorot communities near the disaster areas quickly responded with rescue and rehabilitation operations, bringing rice, other food, shovels and other needed items for the typhoon victims. Our traditional values, ethics and practice of solidarity, mutual aid and reciprocity, collectivity and support for the weakest and most vulnerable came into full play. While the recent global economic crisis also affected the Cordillera region, its impacts were not as significant as those brought about by climate change. The devastated communities were those where foreign and national mining companies had operated from 30 to 100 years and, along with those still around, did not rehabilitate after they left.

We did not cause the problems of climate change or the economic crisis nor we did benefit from mining operations, but we bear the heaviest burden of adapting to all of their adverse impacts. We, thus, see climate change as a case of environmental injustice. While rich countries have historically caused 80% of the greenhouse gas emissions we now suffer from, they have not issued much support in the form of relief and adaptation funds. They owe developing countries, nations and peoples’ climate and adaptation debts. Thus, under the UNFCCC and Kyoto Protocol, they are obliged to provide developing countries the finances and technologies for mitigation and adaptation, aside from cutting their domestic greenhouse gas emissions deeply.

 

Indigenous peoples and multilateral system

Our participation in multilateral bodies and initiatives are attempts to make more visible the continuing violation of our collective and individual rights, and articulate our worldviews, values and practices of sustainable development. It has been more than 30 years since indigenous peoples started to participate in greater numbers in the UN system, which has deepened our understanding of the value and challenges of multilateralism. This has also led to the adoption of policies and declarations on indigenous peoples' rights and the establishment of mechanisms and spaces dealing with indigenous issues.

Among the fruits of our engagement in the UN are:

the adoption of ILO Convention No. 169 on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples (1989);
adoption of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (2007);
establishment of the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (2000);
the UN Special Rapporteur on human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people (2000);
the Expert Mechanism on Indigenous Peoples' Rights (2008);
UNDP Policy of Engagement with Indigenous Peoples (2000); and
World Bank Revised Operational Policy and Bank Policy 4.10 on Indigenous Peoples (2005), among others.
Unfortunately, our engagement with the Human Development Report and Human Development Index and the processes around the Millennium Development Goals has not been as extensive as we had hoped for. xxx.

 

Indigenous peoples' self-determined development or development with culture and identity

For self-determined development to be realized, UNDRIP has to be effectively implemented, along with other human rights and international instruments. The right to culture and identity, as contained in UNDRIP, CERD Recommendation XXIII and UNESCO Convention on Cultural Diversity, are also crucial elements of self-determined development.
In addition. the ecosystem approach to development, to biodiversity conservation and to mitigation and adaptation to climate change also has to be implemented. The CBD, which has adopted the Ecosystem Approach as its primary framework for action, defines it as the strategy for the integrated management of land, water and living resources that promote conservation and sustainable use in an equitable way. It involves taking account of vital ecosystem functions and valuing the ecological goods and services they provide in all decision-making processes or what is also referred to as natural capital. For indigenous peoples, this is simply obeying the laws of nature and practicing the indigenous values of mutual reciprocity. respect for Mother Earth and solidarity. We know too well that if we do not treat nature and other living beings as "our relations," we and our future generations will suffer the consequences of our misbehavior. This is natural law.

The IPs have their own views of development and wellbeing that must be considered in determining development models and approaches. The language of development as understood by dominant societies does not have equivalents in indigenous worldviews and languages. Thus, instead of using "development," several efforts are being made to advance indigenous concepts of wellbeing or living well. Latin America, for example, has variations of this: among the Quechua, it is sumajkausay (sumaj, beautiful, good; kausay, to live); the indigenous peoples in Bolivia and now the government have the concept of buenvivir(living well); the Maya use the word utzil (utz, well being; il, well living).

Among the Kankana-ey Igorot, we say gawis ay biag(good life), which is loaded with many rules and taboos. These taboos are embedded in the concept of innayanwhich generally means "do not do it." Thus, we say innayan if you cut a tree and sell it to earn money or when you redirect irrigation water to your own field without equitably distributing it when you are assigned to mananom(refers to indigenous water management system)." If you flout the customary laws on forest or water management, accompanying sanctions will be imposed on you. Most of us respect these, and this explains why we still have tropical forests in our territories unlike the vast majority of communities of the dominant populations in the Philippines. We also practice mutual labor exchange called ug-ugbowhen we plant, harvest, build houses, care for the sick and aged, and during weddings and death rituals. The care for the earth or what economists would call natural capital or assets and the strong social capital in terms of caring for each other are what we consider our wealth. We may not be rich materially, but we are wealthy in terms of values and the ecological integrity of our territories which we can bequeath to our future generations.

The Miskitu peoples of Nicaragua have similar rules linked to development called lamanlaka, which can be interpreted as rules of coexistence, offering harmony within the family regardless of age or gender. It might be akin to what sociologists and anthropologists term as "social fabric." Lamanlaka establishes economic norms on land use, signifying "if you have, you have; if you have it, I have it." This involves labor exchange or panapana, which allows interaction between people and marked by the value of the word, respect for family, trust, ethnic loyalty and the commonwealth."

Current work on indicators on indigenous peoples’ wellbeing and development is also helping to bring to the surface more indigenous perspectives on these. In a joint project of CBD, Permanent Forum and Tebteba, the lead in the International Indigenous Forum on Biodiversity Working Group on Indicators, indigenous peoples themselves identified the core issues to serve as basis for developing indicators of wellbeing and sustainability. Those identified in regional and global processes include the following:

security of rights to territories, lands and natural resources,
integrity of cultural heritage,
respect for identity and non-discrimination,
culturally appropriate education,
fate control or self-determination,
full, informed and effective participation,
health,
access to infrastructure and basic services,
extent of external threats,
material well-being,
gender, and
demographic pattern of indigenous peoples.
The next step is to identify indicators which will measure progress in achieving these
